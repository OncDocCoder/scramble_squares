# scramble_squares
Change later
#scramble squares is a puzzle game.  The idea is to match the sides of a 3x3 grid of squares.  I took the sides, which were in my case, guitars, sharks and cars, and changed the pictures into numbers.  If it is a top or a front of a guitar, car or fish, it is positive. If it is the bottom or back of one, it is negative.  I am able to come up with a solution, but I'm still having a value error that occurs during the last loop--any help with that would be appreciated.  Another thing that would be cool is to take the cards and put pictures into a grid, either a website or a grid that shows the final solution.  This would involve exporting the pictures from the program into the grid in the correct place with the correct rotation.
